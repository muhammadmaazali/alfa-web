                    As a manufacturer of offshore accommodation modules, ALFA MARINE maintains rigorous product
                    development discipline in new product conceptualization, requirements definition, design and
                    engineering execution. Whether it is a single, custom offshore module or an accommodation complex,
                    we design every aspect of the product or project from the interior layout to how many levels we can
                    stack to the configuration for walkways, stairs, railings and other support infrastructure. When we
                    initiate a custom project, we start with a requirements definition. With our expert team across
                    sales, project management and engineering, we will work with your team to fully capture all the
                    specifications necessary to successfully complete the project. As a custom project advances from
                    pre-sale planning to post award, our project management team initiates actions across engineering,
                    fabrication, supply chain, logistics and installation support. The engineering team uses 3D design
                    software programs such as SolidWorks and other software tools to design and model both individual
                    modules and stacked and linked temporary living quarters complexes.
